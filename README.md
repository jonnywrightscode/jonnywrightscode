- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonny Wright.
- 👷 I'm a data scientist and product manager taking time out to learn the skills required to build apps.
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - data analysis and machine learning,
  - web and mobile app development,
  - product and project management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment but that will change once I have got to grips with web development.
