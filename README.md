- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonny Wright @jonnywrightscode (geddit?!).
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, machine learning, web and mobile app development, product and project management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development.
- 👷 I'm a data analyst and product manager taking time out to learn the skills required to build apps.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment but that will change once I feel more comfortable with web development.
